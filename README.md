This is supplemental material accompanying paper [Predicting variability in nascent RNA from transcription initiation kinetics](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.30.486441). Here you can find computer code that predicts nascent RNA number distribution from the distribution of the times between successive transcription initiation events. 

The files are organised as follows:
| File | Type | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
|`eukaryotic-transcription-SSA.ipynb`|Jupyter notebook file with Julia code| Computes the initiation time distribution and the nascent RNA distribution using stochastic simulations|
|`eukaryotic-transcription-exact.nb`|Mathematica notebook file|Computes the initiation time distribution and the nascent RNA distribution using inverse Laplace transform|
